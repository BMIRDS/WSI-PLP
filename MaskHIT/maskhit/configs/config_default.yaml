# Dataset and Model Configuration File
# This configuration file sets parameters for dataset preprocessing and model training.
# Modify values in config_user.yaml to override defaults.

# NOTE: To override any values in this file, please create config_user.yaml 
# (or any YAML file name of you like).
# In config_user.yaml, only define the variables you wish to update. 
# Unmentioned variables will use the default values specified here.
# Please avoid directly modifying values in this file.
#
# Documentation Tags:
#  (default): variables can be left with their default values
#  (custom): more likely to need modification for each user
